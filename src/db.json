Bokhtar (Tajik: Бохтар),[3] previously known as Qurghonteppa, Kurganteppa and Kurgan-Tyube, is a city in southwestern Tajikistan, which serves as the capital of the Khatlon region. Bokhtar is the largest city in southern Tajikistan, and is located 100 kilometres (62 mi) south of Dushanbe and 150 kilometres (93 mi) north of Kunduz, Afghanistan. As of 2019, the city's population was estimated at 110,800, making it the third-largest city in the country. The population fluctuates depending on the season, due to the many Tajik migrant workers in Russia. Along with the capital Dushanbe, Bokhtar is more demographically diverse than other major Tajik cities such as Khujand, Kulob or Istaravshan.[4] Its population includes Tajiks, Uzbeks, Russians, Pashtuns, Tatars, Ukrainians, Kazakhs, Greeks, and many more.[citation needed] The city had a large number of ethnic Russians who worked in the industrial and agricultural complexes in and around the city. Bokhtar is a stronghold of Tajikistan's political opposition.",
